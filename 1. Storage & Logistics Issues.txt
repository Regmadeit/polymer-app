1. Storage & Logistics Issues:
Challenge:
Our storage consistently reaches capacity, leading to operational slowdowns, excess inventory holding, and increased costs.

Immediate Actions:
Redirecting incoming shipments due to space constraints.

Proposed Solutions:
Implementing a Just-In-Time (JIT) system, aligning production closely with buyer schedules.
Consolidating shipments to maximize trailer capacity and reduce frequency.
Establishing direct communication channels with key partners like Blue Polymer to optimize scheduling and efficiency.

2. Cross-Training Initiative:
Objective:
Enhance operational flexibility, efficiency, and productivity.

Current Actions:
Actively cross-training all forklift drivers and operators across key areas:
Inbound & Outbound logistics
Washline operations
Baler and Crosswrap processes

Expected Benefits:
Increased workforce flexibility.
Reduced downtime and operational delays.
Improved employee engagement and skill development.

3. Real-Time Logistics & Inventory Management App:
Status:
Developed a proof-of-concept app for real-time inventory tracking, logistics management, and operator reporting.

Capabilities:
Real-time alerts on storage capacity thresholds.
Automated shipment scheduling and logistics coordination.

Next Steps:
Full integration into operations.
Expanded testing and feedback cycle with operators and logistics partners.
